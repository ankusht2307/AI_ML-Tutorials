Task: Predicting Survival in the Titanic Data Set

We will be using a Decision Tree and Random Forest to make predictions about the Titanic data. 
This data set provides information on the Titanic passengers and can be used to predict whether a passenger survived or not.

Dataset to be utilized -- titanic-train.csv

Algorithm to Apply -- Decision Tree and Random Forest

titanic.columns =
['PassengerId','Survived','Pclass','Name','Sex','Age','SibSp','Parch','Ti
cket','Fare','Cabin','E mbarked']

You use only Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp (Siblings aboard), Parch (Parents/children aboard), and Fare to predict whether a passenger survived.
